## Game Leaflet

![cover.png](/Development/cover.png)

A modern take on the arcade classic: **Asteroid**, this time with a black hole included! Weave through asteroids as you fly to **stay alive for as long as possible** before you **fall into the abyss**.

If you want a challenge try surviving as close to the black hole as you can and you'll ramp up your score quickly, or chill on the outer rim for an easy but unrewarding game.

Either way you must watch out for **asteroids, they will seriously perturb your orbit** and can throw you to your doom.

**Your engine gets weaker with every asteroid collision**, so watch out, you may not be able to escape the black hole's pull as quickly...

### Controls
- **W** to apply thrust in the direction you face, **thrust along your orbit (green circle) to increase your radius**, slow down to fall. **KSP players will be familiar**.
- **A/D** to rotate your ship.

### Engine
This game was made entirely using the MonoGame C# library! This Ludum Dare we decided to challenge ourselves and not use Unity, and instead try making our own mini engine in which we would have our game made in!
